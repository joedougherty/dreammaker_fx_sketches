It uses an FM synth engine along with ADSR envelope generator and an output filter.  The pedal is configured by default to use a triangle (OSC_TRIANGLE) wave that is modulated with a sine wave (OSC_SINE).  However, lots of interesting sounds can be created by swapping these out with out types of oscillators (e.g. OSC_SQUARE, OSC_RAMP_POS, OSC_RAMP_NEG, OSC_RANDOM, etc).", "left-pot-label": "FM mod depth", "left-pot-function": "The depth of the FM mod in the synthesizer", "center-pot-label": "Attack time", "center-pot-function": "The attack time of the synth sound (i.e. how long it takes  to ramp to full volume when you play a new string)", "right-pot-label": "Modulation frequency", "right-pot-function": "The frequency of the FM modulator ranging from 0.25 x the note played to 4.25x.", "left-switch-label": "Bypass", "left-switch-function": "Bypasses the effect", "right-switch-label": "", "right-switch-function": "describe right footswitch function", "youtube-url": "", "soundcloud-url": "https://soundcloud.com/dreammakerfx/polyphonic-synth-guitar-effect-on-dreammaker-fx"}
