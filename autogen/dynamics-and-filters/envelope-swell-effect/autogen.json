{"category": "Dynamics-And-Filters", "modules": ["fx_adsr_envelope"], "name": "Attack Decay Swell", "description": "This is an example that shows how to use the fx_adsr_envelope effect to control the attack and decay of a played note.  The ADSR envelope standads  for attack-decay-sustain-release and controls how quickly a note fades and out.   The sketch also demonstrates how to route the new note pedal event to the ADSR envelope  so each time you play a new note, the ADSR envelope is applied.  By turning attack and release way down, each note sounds like a quick pluck.  And increase attack creates a swell  effect like an ebow.", "left-pot-label": "Attack time", "left-pot-function": "Lenght of attack from 50ms to 1000ms", "center-pot-label": "Gain", "center-pot-function": "Volume of output.
