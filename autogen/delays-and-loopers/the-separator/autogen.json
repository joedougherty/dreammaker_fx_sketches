And then play over them.  The effect uses a tight low-pass filter to cut off all frequencies above 100-300Hz (controlled via left pot).  The output of this runs through a compressor to make the bass notes  solid with even volume.  And then the output of the compressor runs into the delay.", "left-pot-label": "Low pass cutoff", "left-pot-function": "The cutoff frequency of filter feeding delay", "center-pot-label": "Delay time", "center-pot-function": "Length of time between echoes", "right-pot-label": "Bass gain", "right-pot-function": "Output level of repeating bass notes", "left-switch-label": "Bypass", "left-switch-function": "Bypasses the effect", "right-switch-label": "Tap delay", "right-switch-function": "Tap it a few times at a set interval and the delay will lock on", "youtube-url": "https://youtu.be/YtXOiU8ff68", "soundcloud-url": "", "creator": "DreamMaker", "package-version": "", "sketch-version": ""}
