And then play over them.  The effect uses a tight low-pass filter to cut off all frequencies above 100-300Hz (controlled via left pot).  The output of this runs through a compressor to make the bass notes  solid with even volume.  And then the output of the compressor runs into the delay.", "left-pot-label": "Low pass cutoff", "left-pot-function": "The cutoff frequency of filter feeding delay", "center-pot-label": "Delay time", "center-pot-function": "Length of time between echoes", "right-pot-label": "Bass gain", "right-pot-function": "Output level of repeating bass notes", "left-switch-label": "Bypass", "left-switch-function": "Bypasses the effect", "right-switch-label": "Tap delay", "right-switch-function": "Tap it a few times at a set interval and the delay will lock on", "youtube-url": "https://youtu.be/YtXOiU8ff68", "soundcloud-url": "", "creator": "DreamMaker", "package-version": "1.5.3", "sketch-version": "1.0", "fn": "the-separator.ino", "path": "delays-and-loopers/the-separator/", "ino_path": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/runjumplabs/dreammaker_fx_sketches/master/autogen/delays-and-loopers/the-separator/the-separator.ino", "html_path": "https://runjumplabs.github.io/dreammaker_fx/autogen/delays-and-loopers/the-separator/autogen_syntax.html", "uf2_path": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/runjumplabs/dreammaker_fx_sketches/master/autogen/delays-and-loopers/the-separator/CURRENT.UF2", "zip_path": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/runjumplabs/dreammaker_fx_sketches/master/autogen/delays-and-loopers/the-separator/the-separator.zip"}
