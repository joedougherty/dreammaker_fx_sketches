The duration  of the second looper is synchronized to the first.  Hold down the left footswitch  to record the first loop.  Then hold down the right footswitch to record a second layer. Tapping either of the footswitches after the record will clear that loop. The left pot controls loop 1 volume, the right pot controls loop 2 volume and the  center pot controls a gentle low-pass filter over the loops.", "left-pot-label": "Primary loop mix", "left-pot-function": "Sets volume of primary loop controlled with left switch", "center-pot-label": "Filter", "center-pot-function": "Sets cutoff of low-pass filter that loops run through", "right-pot-label": "Secondary loop mix", "right-pot-function": "Sets the volume of the secondary loop controlled with right swtich", "left-switch-label": "Record primary", "left-switch-function": "Records the primary loop", "right-switch-label": "Record secondary", "right-switch-function": "Records the secondary loop", "youtube-url": "", "soundcloud-url": "", "creator": "DreamMaker", "package-version": "", "sketch-version": ""}
