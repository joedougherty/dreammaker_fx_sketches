The echo effect  is set to 1/4 the lenght of the loop so each time a new loop is set, the echo time  is updated to.  The looper output also runs through a low-pass filter with a bit  of resonance so you can turn the recorded loop into a cool background droning  pattern.", "left-pot-label": "Echo feedback", "left-pot-function": "Feedback amount for echoes (how long it takes them to disappear)", "center-pot-label": "Looper mix", "center-pot-function": "Amount of looper in the output mix", "right-pot-label": "Looper filter", "right-pot-function": "Low pass filter with some gentle resonance on the output of the looper", "left-switch-label": "Bypass", "left-switch-function": "Bypasses the effect", "right-switch-label": "Record / reset", "right-switch-function": "Hold down to record a loop.
